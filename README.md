# Snake Game

A fun and interactive Snake Game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game features a simple user interface, local storage for saving scores, a leaderboard to track top players, and various options such as pausing and restarting the game.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Game**: Control the snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and its own tail.
- **Leaderboard**: A leaderboard that ranks players based on their highest score. Players can view top scores and see their ranking.
- **User Profiles**: New users are prompted to enter their name, and it is stored for future play. Returning players can see their highest score.
- **Pause and Restart**: The game can be paused at any time, and players can restart the game from the beginning.
- **Responsive Design**: The game layout is designed to work on various screen sizes.

## Getting Started

To run the game locally on your machine, follow these simple steps:

### How It Works

- The game is controlled using the arrow keys, where the snake moves in the selected direction and eats food to grow.
- Each time the snake eats food, the score increases, and the game continues until the snake collides with the wall or itself.
- Upon game over, the user’s highest score is saved to the browser’s local storage and can be viewed in the leaderboard.
